# CTL Digital Shout

Red means disconnected state.
Blue means connected state.
If any of the endpoint starts to flicker, it means they have lost "seeing" them. However it doesn't mean they have lost the connection.
An endpoint can be un-seen but still exist/be connected.

Shout sends all the messages to all the listed beacons.
Send button sends the message individually.
